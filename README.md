Here’s your fully formatted, **formal and comment-supported** `README.md` that you can paste directly into your `customer-segmentation-analysis/` folder and GitHub repo. I've removed emojis and made sure everything is crystal-clear for business, academic, and portfolio presentation purposes.

# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Client
Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC), Malawi

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning, specifically K-Means clustering, to segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior. The purpose is to help ADMARC improve decision-making in product distribution, marketing, and resource allocation.

By identifying distinct customer groups, ADMARC can better serve smallholder farmers, strengthen supply chain efficiency, and support its mission of promoting food security in Malawi.

---

## Objectives
- Segment customers into meaningful clusters using K-Means
- Enable data-driven marketing and distribution strategies
- Identify high-value vs. low-frequency customer groups
- Improve ADMARC’s efficiency and transparency in operations

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

* Clean and preprocess data (handle nulls, correct types)
* Feature engineering to derive new useful metrics
* Scale numerical features for algorithm performance

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyze customer behavior and demographics
* Visualize trends in income, age, and spending scores
* Identify outliers and skewed distributions

### 3. Clustering

* Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm
* Determine optimal number of clusters using:

  * Elbow Method
  * Silhouette Score
* Visualize clustering results using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

### 4. Cluster Interpretation

* Label and explain cluster groups:

  * High-income low-spend
  * Low-income high-spend
  * Middle-tier frequent buyers
* Generate actionable insights for decision-making

### 5. Optional Dashboard (Streamlit)

* Interactive user interface for non-technical staff
* Upload new data and visualize segmentation results
* Export cluster-labeled customer datasets

## Technologies Used

* **Python** for scripting and analysis
* **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Streamlit** for interactive dashboard
* **Jupyter Notebooks** for EDA and prototyping

---

## Business Impact

ADMARC can use this system to:

* Deliver agricultural inputs more efficiently
* Target high-need or high-value customer clusters
* Improve transparency in public service delivery
* Build evidence-based strategies for food distribution and support
